## What is Project Rhizome?

Project Rhizome is a digital tool for cognitive flexibility: 
A space to explore stuck thoughts and discover new ways of thinking. Named after the philosophical concept of rhizomatic thinking (interconnected, non-linear growth), it helps you break free from rigid mental patterns and find fresh perspectives.

## How It Works: The Journey

### 1. The Invitation
Start by identifying a thought that feels stuck, persistent, or troubling. This could be:
- A worry that keeps circling in your mind
- A belief that feels limiting but "logical"
- A judgment about yourself or others
- An assumption you've never questioned
- A feeling that seems permanently stuck

### 2. Assemblage: Multiple Functions
Explore what roles this thought plays in your life. Thoughts aren't just true or false—they serve purposes:
- **Protector**: "This anxiety keeps me safe from disappointment"
- **Organizer**: "This rule helps me make sense of chaos"
- **Connector**: "This belief links me to my family/community"
- **Controller**: "This thought gives me a sense of agency"

### 3. Multiplicities: Paradoxes
Examine how the same thought can be both true and untrue depending on context:
- **Time**: True in the past, less true now
- **Situation**: True at work, false at home
- **Perspective**: True from one angle, false from another
- **Scale**: True individually, false collectively

### 4. Lines of Flight: New Possibilities
Discover alternative ways of thinking that emerge from this exploration:
- What new questions arise?
- What actions become possible?
- How might you hold this thought more lightly?
- What would you explore if this thought weren't fixed?

### 5. Synthesis: Your Journey
Review your complete cognitive journey—from the original stuck thought to new possibilities.

## Common Use Cases

### For Anxiety & Worry
**Starting thought**: "I'm going to fail at this presentation"
- **Assemblage**: This worry protects me from overconfidence, motivates preparation, connects me to others who also feel nervous
- **Multiplicities**: True that I might make mistakes (everyone does), false that mistakes equal total failure
- **Lines of Flight**: Focus on connection with audience rather than perfection; prepare thoroughly then trust the process

### For Self-Criticism
**Starting thought**: "I'm not smart enough for this job"
- **Assemblage**: This thought keeps me humble, pushes me to work harder, protects me from trying things I might fail at
- **Multiplicities**: True that I have knowledge gaps (everyone does), false that intelligence is fixed or singular
- **Lines of Flight**: Curiosity about what I can learn; appreciation for different types of intelligence; growth mindset

### For Relationship Issues
**Starting thought**: "They don't care about me"
- **Assemblage**: This protects me from vulnerability, explains their behavior simply, justifies my own withdrawal
- **Multiplicities**: True that they might be distracted/busy, false that lack of attention equals lack of caring
- **Lines of Flight**: Direct communication about needs; exploring different love languages; considering their perspective

### For Life Transitions
**Starting thought**: "I'm too old to change careers"
- **Assemblage**: This protects me from risk, respects my current investments, acknowledges real constraints
- **Multiplicities**: True that some paths require long training, false that age eliminates all possibilities
- **Lines of Flight**: Gradual transitions; transferable skills; redefining success; learning for intrinsic value

### For Social Anxiety
**Starting thought**: "Everyone is judging me"
- **Assemblage**: This keeps me alert to social cues, motivates good behavior, explains my discomfort
- **Multiplicities**: True that people form impressions, false that they're constantly focused on me
- **Lines of Flight**: Focusing outward on others; self-compassion practices; experimenting with small social risks

## Tips for Effective Use

### Getting Started
- **Be specific**: Instead of "I'm stressed," try "I'll never finish this project on time"
- **Choose something current**: Pick a thought that's actively bothering you
- **Start small**: You don't need to tackle your deepest fears immediately

### During the Process
- **Write freely**: Don't worry about perfect answers—exploration is the goal
- **Be curious**: Approach your thoughts like a friendly scientist
- **Stay open**: Surprising insights often come from unexpected directions
- **Take breaks**: If you feel overwhelmed, pause and return later

### After Completion
- **Review regularly**: Your synthesis can reveal new insights over time
- **Try different thoughts**: Each journey teaches you something about your thinking patterns
- **Share selectively**: Consider discussing insights with trusted friends or therapists

## When to Use Rhizome

- Before important decisions
- When feeling stuck in repetitive thinking

### Therapeutic Contexts
- As homework between therapy sessions
- To prepare for difficult conversations

## What Makes Rhizome Different

Unlike traditional problem-solving, Rhizome doesn't seek to eliminate thoughts or find "the right answer." Instead, it:
- **Honors complexity**: Recognizes that thoughts serve multiple purposes
- **Embraces paradox**: Allows things to be both true and false
- **Opens possibilities**: Focuses on what becomes available rather than what's wrong
- **Builds flexibility**: Strengthens your ability to hold thoughts lightly

## Getting the Most Out of Your Journey

1. **Regular practice**: Like meditation, the benefits compound over time
2. **Diverse thoughts**: Try the process with different types of stuck thinking
3. **Pattern recognition**: Notice recurring themes across your journeys
4. **Integration**: Look for opportunities to apply insights in daily life
5. **Community**: Share experiences with others using similar practices

Remember: The goal isn't to "fix" your thinking, but to develop a more flexible, curious, and compassionate relationship with your own mind.
