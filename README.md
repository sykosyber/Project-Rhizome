# Project-Rhizome
Project Rhizome is a digital tool for cognitive flexibility, a space to explore stuck thoughts and discover new ways of thinking. Named after the philosophical concept of rhizomatic thinking (interconnected, non-linear growth), it helps you break free from rigid mental patterns and find fresh perspectives.
